title-sc: and its rise in the Computer Science ecosystem

concept1: The digital economy has taken over the world.
concept2: A great future is on the horizon for computer science professionals, thanks to the worldwide impact of information techonologies. Good times are coming as we have begun to understand and exploit these changes. 
concept3: "It has become clear that carrers in computer science require professionals able to create new technological products and solutions with international projections.
